      <h3>1. The School for Good and Evil</h3>
      <div class="movie-content">
        <div class="movie-text">
          <p>The School for Good and Evil tells the story of two best friends, Sophie and Agatha, who live in the quiet village of Gavaldon. While Sophie dreams of becoming a fairytale princess, Agatha prefers a darker, more mysterious life. One night, they are magically transported to the School for Good and Evil - a place where children are trained to become heroes or villains in fairytales.
          However, things don’t go as planned. Sophie is placed in the School for Evil, while Agatha ends up in the School for Good. Convinced that a mistake has been made, they try to find a way to switch schools, but as they face magical tests, unexpected friendships, and dark truths, they begin to discover who they truly are.
          Blending fantasy, adventure, and friendship, the movie explores the idea that good and evil are not always as they seem - and that true strength comes from accepting yourself.</p>

      <h5>PERSONAL REVIEW</h5>
      <div class="review-content">
        <div class="review-text">
          <p>I really enjoyed watching The School for Good and Evil. The movie had beautiful visuals, cool magic scenes, and a strong message about friendship and staying true to yourself. I liked how it showed that people aren’t always fully good or fully evil - everyone has a mix of both. That made the characters, especially Agatha and Sophie, feel more real and interesting.
          Agatha was my favourite because she stayed kind and honest even when things got tough. Sophie’s character was more complex, and it was interesting to see how her choices changed the story. Their friendship had ups and downs, but it was the heart of the movie.
          Some parts felt a bit fast or slightly confusing, but overall, it was still fun to watch. The setting, costumes, and magical moments made the whole movie feel like a fairytale with a twist.
          If you enjoy fantasy, magic, and stories about friendship and self-discovery, I would say this movie is definitely worth watching.</p>
