      <h3>2. DAMSEL</h3>
      <div class="movie-content">
        <div class="movie-text">
          <p>Elodie, a brave and independent young woman, agrees to marry Prince Henry from a powerful kingdom, hoping for a better future. But after a grand wedding, she discovers a horrifying truth - she has been chosen as a sacrifice to a deadly dragon, part of a dark tradition used to protect the royal family’s power.
          Trapped in a deep, dangerous cave, Elodie realizes no one is coming to rescue her. Using her courage, intelligence, and strength, she fights to survive. Along the way, she uncovers the truth about past sacrifices and the kingdom’s betrayal.
          Instead of becoming a helpless victim, Elodie transforms into a fighter and takes control of her fate. She battles the dragon, escapes the cave, and exposes the royal family's cruel secret.
          Damsel is a thrilling fantasy film that flips the classic fairytale - showing that sometimes, the princess saves herself.</p>

      <h5>PERSONAL REVIEW</h5>
      <div class="review-content">
        <div class="review-text">
          <p>I really enjoyed watching The School for Good and Evil. The movie had beautiful visuals, cool magic scenes, and a strong message about friendship and staying true to yourself. I liked how it showed that people aren’t always fully good or fully evil - everyone has a mix of both. That made the characters, especially Agatha and Sophie, feel more real and interesting.
          Agatha was my favourite because she stayed kind and honest even when things got tough. Sophie’s character was more complex, and it was interesting to see how her choices changed the story. Their friendship had ups and downs, but it was the heart of the movie.
          Some parts felt a bit fast or slightly confusing, but overall, it was still fun to watch. The setting, costumes, and magical moments made the whole movie feel like a fairytale with a twist.
          If you enjoy fantasy, magic, and stories about friendship and self-discovery, I would say this movie is definitely worth w</p>
