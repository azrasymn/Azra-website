      <h3>3. The Fault in Our Stars</h3>
      <div class="movie-content">
        <div class="movie-text">
          <p>The Fault in Our Stars is a romantic drama based on the best-selling novel by John Green. The story follows Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old girl living with thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Forced by her parents to attend a support group, she meets Augustus "Gus" Waters, a charming and witty boy who lost a leg to bone cancer but is now in remission.

          As Hazel and Gus grow closer, they bond over shared humor, intelligence, and a deep love for books — especially Hazel’s favorite novel, An Imperial Affliction. Their connection deepens into love, and they embark on a journey to Amsterdam to meet the author of that novel in search of closure.

          However, their time together is shadowed by the realities of their illnesses. The story explores their emotional journey, filled with laughter, pain, love, and loss — reminding us how even the shortest lives can leave the biggest impact.</p>

      <h5>PERSONAL REVIEW</h5>
      <div class="review-content">
        <div class="review-text">
          <p>Honestly, I didn’t expect The Fault in Our Stars to affect me that much, but it did. The story felt so real and raw. I really connected with Hazel and Gus — their love wasn’t perfect, but it was honest and deep.

          The way they supported each other through pain and uncertainty was so touching. It made me think about how short life can be, and how we should appreciate the people we love while we still can.

          Some parts really broke my heart. I tried not to cry... but yeah, I did. It’s the kind of movie that stays in your mind even after it ends.</p>
