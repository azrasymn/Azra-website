      <h3>5. Cinderella</h3>
      <div class="movie-content">
        <div class="movie-text">
          <p>Cinderella is a classic fairytale about a kind and gentle young woman who remains hopeful and graceful despite the hardships she faces. After losing her parents, Cinderella is forced to live with her cruel stepmother and jealous stepsisters, who treat her like a servant in her own home.

          Even though she’s mistreated, Cinderella never loses her kindness. She continues to be patient, hardworking, and respectful, showing a strong and beautiful heart. Her ability to stay positive and gentle becomes her greatest strength.

          With the help of her Fairy Godmother, Cinderella is magically transformed for one night to attend the royal ball. There, she captures the heart of the Prince — not just because of her beauty, but because of her grace and pure heart. Even when the magic fades, her good nature shines through.

          In the end, her honesty, humility, and kindness lead her to a better life — reminding us that no matter how unfair the world seems, goodness will always find its way back to us.</p>

      <h5>PERSONAL REVIEW</h5>
      <div class="review-content">
        <div class="review-text">
          <p>Cinderella has always been one of my favorite fairytales. It’s not just about magic or a happy ending — it’s about how someone can stay kind, strong, and patient even when life feels completely unfair.

          What I admire most about Cinderella is her attitude. She never fights back with anger, even when she’s treated badly. She just keeps being kind, humble, and respectful. That kind of strength is so rare and inspiring.

          Watching her finally get the life she deserves felt so satisfying — not because of the prince, but because she proved that kindness and goodness do matter. It reminded me that no matter how hard things get, staying true to your values will always take you far.</p>
