      <h3>4. Cruella</h3>
      <div class="movie-content">
        <div class="movie-text">
          <p>Cruella tells the origin story of one of Disney’s most iconic villains — Cruella de Vil — long before the spotted coats and the evil laughs.

          Set in 1970s London, the film follows Estella, a clever and creative young woman with a passion for fashion and a rebellious streak. Orphaned at a young age and forced to survive on the streets, Estella teams up with two street-smart thieves, making a name for herself through mischief and style.

          But everything changes when she catches the eye of Baroness von Hellman, a cold, powerful fashion legend. Their complicated relationship and fierce rivalry awaken a darker side of Estella — the bold and unapologetic Cruella.

          Filled with stunning fashion, punk-rock energy, and unexpected twists, Cruella is a stylish and emotional journey of transformation, revenge, and self-discovery — proving that behind every villain, there’s always a story.</p>

      <h5>PERSONAL REVIEW</h5>
      <div class="review-content">
        <div class="review-text">
          <p>Cruella was such a fun and bold movie. I loved how it showed Estella’s transformation into Cruella in a way that felt emotional yet fierce.

           But the real star? The fashion. Every outfit was a statement — dramatic, edgy, and full of personality. The designs weren’t just pretty, they told a story. From street style to runway looks, Cruella’s fashion was wild, fearless, and unforgettable.</p>
